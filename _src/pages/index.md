Hi there.

I am the co-founder of [Cannabis Wire](https://cannabiswire.com), where I write a daily newsletter focused on cannabis policy, regulation, and research.

I teach at the Columbia Journalism School.

I co-authored [*A New Leaf: The End of Cannabis Prohibition*](https://thenewpress.com/books/new-leaf) (The New Press, 2014).

I'd love to learn about what you're working on, and areas for collaboration in cannabis, journalism, academia, or all of the above.
